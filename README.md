# Independent Study README

**Project Description**

Dining out is a simple and effective way to socialize, but choosing a restaurant that suits everyone's needs can be a challenge, particularly in groups with various dietary restrictions and preferences. This independent study project aims to streamline the restaurant selection process for groups, making it more efficient and enjoyable.

**Motivation**

The idea for this app was born from a frustrating experience during a trip to Charlotte with a group of five people. We spent a significant amount of time searching for a restaurant that offered gluten-free and vegetarian options, was open, and had a short wait time. This experience underscored the difficulty of selecting a restaurant in a group setting and inspired the creation of a solution.

**App Overview**

The app focuses on enhancing the dining experience and saving time by enabling users to vote on a list of restaurants. The key features include:

- Restaurant search and browsing of popular nearby restaurants.
- Creation and joining of groups using unique codes.
- Addition of restaurants to groups and subsequent voting.
- Display of voting results, highlighting the most popular restaurant.

**Differentiation from Existing Apps**

In contrast to other restaurant-related apps, this app stands out due to its unique features:

- Supports collaborative restaurant selection through group voting.
- Offers a distinct group feature for collective decision-making.
- Addresses the challenge of choosing a restaurant in a group context.

**Current App State**

The app's existing functionality includes:

- Ability to search for restaurants and browse nearby popular options.
- Creation and joining of groups using unique codes.
- Addition of restaurants to groups with subsequent voting.
- Display of voting results, featuring the most popular restaurant.

**Known Bugs and Limitations**

- Users face errors if trying to access groups without logging in.
- Attempting to join an already-joined group results in a generic server error.
- Restaurant votes may not always reflect the latest server data.
- The app lacks a user registration system.
- There's no functionality to remove people or restaurants from groups.
- No in-app messaging system for user communication.
- Joining groups requires manual input of group IDs.

**Assumptions**

- Users will communicate externally for coordination.
- Group joining involves manual entry of group IDs.
- There's no provision to send group IDs or links in-app.

**Future Enhancements**

- Implementation of visual restaurant selection via swipe functionality.
- Improved visual appeal and user engagement.
- Introduction of user registration and profile management.
- Empower restaurants to manage listings and provide additional information.
- Refinement of restaurant detail views, including photos, hours, menus, etc.
- Enhancement of the search feature, potentially using natural language processing.
- Introduction of a deals feature in collaboration with closing restaurants.

**Lessons Learned**

- Mastery of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern.
- Understanding of GET and POST requests for data retrieval and submission.
- Utilization of Swift bindings for two-way communication between views.
- Effective management of data presentation using the view-loader-apiclient pattern.
- Debugging using the Xcode debugger and Git version control.
- Design of an efficient database schema for data manipulation.
- Exploration of many-to-many relationships and join tables.
- Integration of user feedback to refine app functionality.

**Conclusion**

The independent study has successfully delivered a functional prototype for group restaurant selection. Feedback from users and testers has driven improvements in functionality, design, and user experience. The prototype's potential to address the challenge of group restaurant selection has been validated, and the groundwork is laid for future development and enhancements.
